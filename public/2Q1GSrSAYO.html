            From Wikipedia:<br>
            Air India Flight 171 was a scheduled passenger flight<br>
            from Ahmedabad Airport in India to London Gatwick Airport <br>
            in the United Kingdom that crashed 32 seconds after takeoff<br>
            at 13:39 IST (08:09 UTC) on 12 June 2025. All 12 crew members<br>
            and 229 of the 230 passengers aboard died. On the ground, <br>
            19 people were killed and 67 others were seriously injured. <br>
            <br><br>
            From BBC:<br>
            The families of four passengers who died on an Air India jet<br>
            that crashed in June have filed a lawsuit in the US against <br>
            planemaker Boeing and aircraft parts maker Honeywell, accusing <br>
            the companies of negligence.
            <br><br>
            The lawsuit filed Tuesday, and seen by the BBC, said faulty <br>
            fuel switches caused the accident and accused the companies of<br>
            doing "nothing" despite being aware of the risks of the <br>
            aircraft's design.
