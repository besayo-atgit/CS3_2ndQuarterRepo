            From Wikipedia:<br>
            Air India Flight 171 was a scheduled passenger flight
            from Ahmedabad Airport in India to London Gatwick Airport 
            in the United Kingdom that crashed 32 seconds after takeoff
            at 13:39 IST (08:09 UTC) on 12 June 2025. All 12 crew members
            and 229 of the 230 passengers aboard died. On the ground, 
            19 people were killed and 67 others were seriously injured. 
            <br><br>
            From BBC:<br>
            The families of four passengers who died on an Air India jet
            that crashed in June have filed a lawsuit in the US against 
            planemaker Boeing and aircraft parts maker Honeywell, accusing 
            the companies of negligence.
            <br><br>
            The lawsuit filed Tuesday, and seen by the BBC, said faulty 
            fuel switches caused the accident and accused the companies of
            doing "nothing" despite being aware of the risks of the 
            aircraft's design.
